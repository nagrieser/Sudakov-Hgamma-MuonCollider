# Sudakov-Hgamma-MuonCollider
Phenomenological measurement of Sudakov corrections in Higgs+photon associated production at possible future muon colliders

Simulation is produced using MadGraph 3.6.3, with the tar file shipped with the repository.  The extraction and build is meant to be performed at the top level of the projection to allow synchronization with different steering scripts.
